            <p style="text-align: center;">I said, “I wish I were older”, but it went
                <br>From crying over a scraped knee,
                <br>And a push on the playground,
                <br>To crying over texts left unseen,
                <br>And the people I can never say a last goodbye to.
            </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                I said, “I wish I were older”, but it changed
                <br>From being excited about growing,
                <br>The excitement of being in control,
                <br>And the freedom of moving out,
                <br>To longing for the comforts of a true “home”,
                <br>And a warmth that I can now only dream about.
            </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                I said “I wish I were older”, but she disappeared,
                <br>The child who once asked a million questions
                <br>About everything in and out of sight,
                <br>To a grown-up, ignorant of the unknown,
                <br>Stuck in a loop that drains them of their might.
            </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                I said, “I wish I were older”, because
                <br>growing up seemed enticing: doing something 24/7 and infinite possibilities,
                <br>But it’s all a scam: being a workaholic does more harm than good,
                <br>And infinite choice is a euphemism for  “liabilities”.
            </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                Now I say, “I wish I were younger”, because
                <br>I just want to scribble on paper,
                <br>Without worrying about judgement,
                <br>And without  a care in the world, because
                <br>This fear of social exile is just another ailment.
            </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                Now I say, “I wish I were younger”, because
                <br>I want the clock to rewind, to show me
                <br>How I could’ve spent my time,
                <br>Skip around in the playground, or
                <br>Play pretend with toys,
                <br>I just want to relive a life without this permanent frown.
            </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                Now I say, “I wish I were younger”,
                <br>because I want to laugh at the silliest of things,
                <br>Not pretend I’m fine when I’m clearly not.
                <br>I wish I had never wished at all.
