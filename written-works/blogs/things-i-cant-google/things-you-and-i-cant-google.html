        <p>Often, we find ourselves stuck in situations where no map—digital or otherwise—can guide us to our destination. Sometimes, we have questions that even a Google search cannot answer. In those moments, you might wonder: who do you turn to for help? That is exactly what we will explore in this blog: things you can’t Google.
        There will be many times in life when Google simply won’t have the answers you need. In those cases, we must turn inward and rely on our own “inner Google”—that personal vault of experiences, lessons, tips, and tricks we’ve gathered over time. Most importantly, these insights aren’t always available online or accessible to AI. They’re learned through making mistakes, embarking on adventures, breaking a few rules, and simply acting without fear or doubt.</p>
        <p>I can say this from experience because I have often found myself in similar situations and, over time, learned to embrace my “inner Google.” Trust me, your “inner Google” doesn’t come with a manual or instructions like your DNA does for the cells in your body. It is something uniquely yours.
        </p>
        <p>For example, when I moved from the place where I had lived since I was two to a new city two years ago, it was hard settling into a new school for the first time. I had never been the “new kid” before, as I had been in one school since kindergarten. It was hard to be in a new house after living in one basically my entire childhood. And there was no inspirational social media influencer or Google that gave me guidelines for settling in. It was experience and my own philosophy that got me through—one that isn’t actually applicable to everyone. But I learned a few things that I like to call the “holy trinity” of my philosophy. These aren’t big, empowering quotes, but a few simple ideas you might want to consider.</p>
        <p>First: There are always people better than you, and sometimes, a previous version of yourself may seem better than who you are now. It’s not that you’ve changed for the worse, but that you’ve evolved. Think of our ancestors, the Neanderthals: they led simple lives and may have been braver or more resourceful than us in some ways, but we have evolved to Homo sapiens and developed things they could never have imagined. In five years, you’ll be another unique version of yourself—making mistakes your past self wouldn’t, but also achieving things they couldn’t dream of.</p>
        <p>Second: People change people, but only if someone wants to change. You might have heard this before, but here’s another perspective: imagine you see an awareness ad urging you to reduce plastic use, and you change your habits because you’re convinced of the consequences of not doing so. Now, imagine you’re the one making the ad, but others don’t change because they aren’t convinced. The point is, if you find it reasonable to learn good habits from those around you, do it—but remember, what is “reasonable” is unique to you. If you wouldn’t change for someone else, don’t expect others to change for you.</p>
        <p>Three: No one really cares about what you do, how you look, what you wear, or how you smell. If people talk about you, it’s often because they want attention. Don’t give their insecurities your attention, and don’t overthink your own actions or appearance for their sake. In the end, whatever you do, don’t do it for someone else—or even just for yourself. Do it because you truly want to.</p>
        <p>In the end, not everything worth knowing can be found online or explained by someone else. Some answers and some questions are hidden within your own experiences, mistakes, and quiet moments of reflection. So, the next time you find yourself searching for guidance, remember to trust your “inner Google.” It’s a resource built uniquely by you, for you—one that grows richer with every challenge you face and every lesson you learn.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading—here’s to trusting yourself a little more each day! Stay curious and keep exploring your own journey! :))</p>
