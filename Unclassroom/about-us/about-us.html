            <h1 id="header">Who Are We?</h1>
            <p>Unclassroom is a digital platform where young people can document learning experiences that occur outside the classroom. We don’t just learn about the world around us from school; learning is all around us. Unclassroom seeks to celebrate this by encouraging youth to submit creative works that reflect on life lessons shaped by their environments, relationships, identities, and challenges.</p>
            <h1>Vision & Mission</h1>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; color: var(--red);">Vision: </span>to empower youth to become agents of change through creative expression, and promote learning without walls.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; color: var(--red);">Mission: </span>to build a global, youth-led platform that amplifies creative expression, learning through storytelling, and critical thought, empowering young people to embrace their life experiences through storytelling, art, dialogue, and collaboration.</p>
